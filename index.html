          HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it provides the foundation and basic structure of a webpage. It's the basic building block of the web. It allows us to break text into headers, paragraphs (for long-form writing), and other basic structures associated with, say, a word document. And, like in a word processor, you can make text bold, italic, or designate text as a quote pulled from another source.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML lets us manually mark up text in a document so the browser knows what to do with that text and how to display it. You begin by wrapping various text with tags, which are keywords and sometimes even single letters surrounded by angle brackets. HTML documents are connected to each other using links.

        <p>An HTML element consist of three parts: the opening tag, the content, and the closing tag</p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>The opening tag</b> - The name of the element (or sometimes just a single letter) surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets. In the example above, what we have is a paragraph tag.</li>
            <li><b>The content</b> - This is the content that will ultimately end up being displayed on the website, and it's what we're instructing our browswer to format via HTML tags</li>
            <li><b>The closing tag</b> - the closing tag ends our element, indicating where we want formatting to stop. Like the opening tag, it's written using two angle brackets, but it also includes a backslash.</li>
          </ul>

        <p>There's a few set of HTML elements that we must include in every website, and they operate as instructions for the browser, telling it that we're writing an HTML document and thus it needs to be rendered as such in the browser. Many developers save the following code as a snippet so they don't have to write it over and over again, and the popular editor plugin Emmet saves all of it to a keyword that will automatically populate your HTML document with the code upon using it.</p>
          <code>
            <strong>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</strong>
            <strong>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</strong>
              <strong>&lt;head&gt;</strong>
                <strong>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</strong>
                <strong>&lt;title&gt;</strong>My sweet website<strong>&lt;/title&gt;</strong>
              <strong>&lt;/head&gt;</strong>
              <strong>&lt;body&gt;</strong>
                <strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong>Hello, world!<strong>&lt;/p&gt;</strong>
              <strong>&lt;/body&gt;</strong>
            <strong>&lt;/html&gt;</strong>
          </code>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>!DOCTYPE</b> - it used to be that an HTML needed to follow a specific set of rules to be considered good HTML, and the doctype acted as a link to those rules. You don't need to follow those rules or link to them, but this is the bare minimum we need to include to make our website work</li>
            <li>
              <b>HTML</b> - this is your root element. It wraps all of the content on your page
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>HEAD</b> - This wraps up information associated with your website, but isn't necessarily content that is viewable on your page. It's where you can put the title and keywords or a description for your website that will show up in search engines
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>META</b> - This specifies the character set that will be used on your document. In this case, we're using UTF-8, which includes most of the characters for the vast majority of human written languages.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>TITLE</b> - The title of your website! It's what will appear in the tab of the browser or in a bookmark menu if someone adds the page to their bookmarks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>BODY</b> - This is the element that will wrap all of your viewable content. It's your working space where you'll add text, images, interactive media like videos, audio, etc.
            </li>

        <p>Despite the wide variety of design seen in websites, most sites rely on the same standard components to provide structure and organize information. There are elements for the three components seen on just about any website you come across: the <strong>header</strong>, the <strong>main</strong> section, and a <strong>footer</strong>, and all three have their own tags!
        <code>
          <strong>&lt;header&gt;</strong>
            Welcome to my Website!
          <strong>&lt;/header&gt;</strong>

          <strong>&lt;main&gt;</strong>
            I ♥ coffee, black metal, and coding
          <strong>&lt;/main&gt;</strong>

          The <strong>header</strong> is typically seen across the top of the website and is usually reserved for a logo and navigation, and sometimes navigation. It can also be ussed to designate the heading of an article or a new section of the document.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>main</strong> element, as indicated by the name, contains the main section of a website. This is where most of the content is. On a blog, this may contain all of the individual blog posts, and on a website like YouTube it will contain the video you're watching, the description and meta information, and the comment section.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>footer</strong> is located at the bottom of the page and, like on a document in the real world, may contain copyright information and fine print. Some of the information seen in the header may be repeated here, as well, and often companies will include links to their social media accounts.
