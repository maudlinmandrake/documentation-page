          HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it provides the foundation and basic structure of a webpage. It's the basic building block of the web. It allows us to break text into headers, paragraphs (for long-form writing), and other basic structures associated with, say, a word document. And, like in a word processor, you can make text bold, italic, or designate text as a quote pulled from another source.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML lets us manually mark up text in a document so the browser knows what to do with that text and how to display it. You begin by wrapping various text with tags, which are keywords and sometimes even single letters surrounded by angle brackets. HTML documents are connected to each other using links.

        <p>An HTML element consist of three parts: the opening tag, the content, and the closing tag</p>
        <img src="img/html_element.png" alt="A diagram of an HTML element with the parts labelled"/>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>The opening tag</b> - The name of the element (or sometimes just a single letter) surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets. In the example above, what we have is a paragraph tag.</li>
            <li><b>The content</b> - This is the content that will ultimately end up being displayed on the website, and it's what we're instructing our browswer to format via HTML tags</li>
            <li><b>The closing tag</b> - the closing tag ends our element, indicating where we want formatting to stop. Like the opening tag, it's written using two angle brackets, but it also includes a backslash.</li>
          </ul>

        <p>There's a few set of HTML elements that we must include in every website, and they operate as instructions for the browser, telling it that we're writing an HTML document and thus it needs to be rendered as such in the browser. Many developers save the following code as a snippet so they don't have to write it over and over again, and the popular editor plugin Emmet saves all of it to a keyword that will automatically populate your HTML document with the code upon using it.</p>
          <code>
            <strong>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</strong>
            <strong>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</strong>
              <strong>&lt;head&gt;</strong>
                <strong>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</strong>
                <strong>&lt;title&gt;</strong>My sweet website<strong>&lt;/title&gt;</strong>
              <strong>&lt;/head&gt;</strong>
              <strong>&lt;body&gt;</strong>
                <strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong>Hello, world!<strong>&lt;/p&gt;</strong>
              <strong>&lt;/body&gt;</strong>
            <strong>&lt;/html&gt;</strong>
          </code>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>!DOCTYPE</b> - it used to be that an HTML needed to follow a specific set of rules to be considered good HTML, and the doctype acted as a link to those rules. You don't need to follow those rules or link to them, but this is the bare minimum we need to include to make our website work</li>
            <li>
              <b>HTML</b> - this is your root element. It wraps all of the content on your page
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>HEAD</b> - This wraps up information associated with your website, but isn't necessarily content that is viewable on your page. It's where you can put the title and keywords or a description for your website that will show up in search engines
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>META</b> - This specifies the character set that will be used on your document. In this case, we're using UTF-8, which includes most of the characters for the vast majority of human written languages.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>TITLE</b> - The title of your website! It's what will appear in the tab of the browser or in a bookmark menu if someone adds the page to their bookmarks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>BODY</b> - This is the element that will wrap all of your viewable content. It's your working space where you'll add text, images, interactive media like videos, audio, etc.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>An important HTML element that should be mentioned before we dive into the basic building blocks for a website is the <strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong> tag, which is used to transform text into a clickable element that leads you to another HTML document. These are called <strong>links</strong> and while it doesn't seem significant on its own, links are the glue of the Internet. They're what creates the "web" in World Wide Web!</p>
        <code>
          <strong>&lt;a href="www.google.com"&gt;</strong>Google<strong>&lt;/a&gt;</strong>
          <strong>&lt;a href="surprise.html"&gt;</strong>Click Me!<strong>&lt;/a&gt;</strong>
          <strong>&lt;a href="mailto:test@fakeemail.com"&gt;</strong>Send Me an Email<strong>&lt;/a&gt;</strong>
        </code>
          <p>The <strong>href</strong> that you see above is what is referred to as an <strong>attribute</strong>, and they append additional information to an HTML tag, and sometimes can alter behavior. In this case, the <strong>href</strong> attribute is what you use to assign a URL to a piece of text enclosed by the <strong>a</strong> tag.</p>
          <p><strong>*NOTE</strong>: If you're wondering, HREF is short for Hypertext REFerence. </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Establishing_Structure">
        <header>Establishing Structure</header>
        <p>Despite the wide variety of design seen in websites, most sites rely on the same standard components to provide structure and organize information. There are elements for the three components seen on just about any website you come across: the <strong>header</strong>, the <strong>main</strong> section, and a <strong>footer</strong>, and all three have their own tags!
        </p>
        <code>
          <strong>&lt;header&gt;</strong>
            Welcome to my Website!
          <strong>&lt;/header&gt;</strong>

          <strong>&lt;main&gt;</strong>
            I â™¥ coffee, black metal, and coding
          <strong>&lt;/main&gt;</strong>

          <strong>&lt;/footer&gt;</strong>
        </code>
        <p>
          The <strong>header</strong> is typically seen across the top of the website and is usually reserved for a logo and navigation, and sometimes navigation. It can also be used to designate the heading of an article or a new section of the document.
        </p>
        <p>In the header, you can often find another handy HTML element, the <strong>nav</strong> element. It's used to designate navigation in some form or another (usually in the header or as a sidebar)</p>
          <code>
            <strong>&lt;nav&gt;</strong>
              <strong>&lt;a href="about.html"&gt;</strong>About<strong>&lt;/a&gt;</strong>
              <strong>&lt;a href="blog.html"&gt;</strong>Blog<strong>&lt;/a&gt;</strong>
            <strong>&lt;/nav&gt;</strong>
          </code>
        <p>
          The <strong>main</strong> element, as indicated by the name, contains the main section of a website. This is where most of the content is. On a blog, this may contain all of the individual blog posts, and on a website like YouTube it will contain the video you're watching, the description and meta information, and the comment section.
        </p>
        <p>Within the main section, you'll often find the <strong>article</strong> and <strong>section</strong> elements being used. You can use them to further break down your main content area. For example, on YouTube, one section could be the video itself, and another section would be the comments. It groups content together by theme. An article, on the other hand, is a piece of information that can be reused and presented on its own (a blog post, for example)</p>
        <code>
          <strong>&lt;section&gt;</strong>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
          <strong>&lt;/section&gt;</strong>

          <strong>&lt;article&gt;</strong>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
          <strong>&lt;/article&gt;</strong>
        </code>
        <p>Visually, neither of these tags make a difference when marking up an HTML document, but semantically, they're important for developers and browsers, as they each have an ideal use case.</p>
        <p>
          The <strong>footer</strong> is located at the bottom of the page and, like on a document in the real world, may contain copyright information and fine print. Some of the information seen in the header may be repeated here, as well, and often companies will include links to their social media accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          A popular, catch-all HTML element that is often used when structuring and organizing content is the division or <strong>div</strong> tag. Before HTML5 and the addition of elements like <strong>header</strong> or <strong>article</strong>, <strong>div</strong> was the popular choice to divide up an HTML document.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Formatting_Text">
        <header>Formatting Text</header>
        <p>Just like when you're working on a document in Microsoft Word or Apple's Pages, you can format the appearance of your text to make it large, italicized, or bold. Here's a list of the the most commonly used HTML tags for formatting text.</p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>&lt;b&gt;</strong><strong>&lt;/b&gt;</strong> or <strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong><strong>&lt;/strong&gt;</strong> is used to make text bold. The <strong>strong</strong> tag is preferred because it's more semantically correct (that is, the tag adds addictional meaning to the text)
            </li>
            <li><strong>&lt;i&gt;</strong><strong>&lt;/i&gt;</strong> or <strong>&lt;em&gt;</strong><strong>&lt;/em&gt;</strong> will italicize your text. Like the <strong>strong</strong> tag above, the <strong>em</strong> tag is preferred.</li>
            <li><strong>&lt;u&gt;</strong><strong>&lt;/u&gt;</strong> will underline your text</li>
            <li><strong>&lt;pre&gt;</strong><strong>&lt;/pre&gt;</strong> defines preformatted text: this is text that uses a fixed-width font, and will also preserve spaces and line breaks. A good example of this is the code you see in the black boxes throughout this document.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>You can also define headings of varying levels using the header tags. There are 6 of them, designating a hierarchy of information</p>
        <code>
          <strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong>This is a level 1 heading; it's the largest<strong>&lt;/h1&gt;</strong>
          <strong>&lt;h2&gt;</strong>This is a level 2 heading<strong>&lt;/h2&gt;</strong>
          <strong>&lt;h3&gt;</strong>This is a level 3 heading<strong>&lt;/h3&gt;</strong>
          <strong>&lt;h4&gt;</strong>This is a level 4 heading<strong>&lt;/h4&gt;</strong>
          <strong>&lt;h5&gt;</strong>This is a level 5 heading<strong>&lt;/h5&gt;</strong>
          <strong>&lt;h6&gt;</strong>This is a level 6 heading; it's the smallest<strong>&lt;/h6&gt;</strong>
        </code>
        <p>When rendered in the browser, the above will look like this:
          <h1>This is a level 1 heading; it's the largest</h1>
          <h2>This is a level 2 heading</h2>
          <h3>This is a level 3 heading</h3>
          <h4>This is a level 4 heading</h4>
          <h5>This is a level 5 heading</h5>
          <h6>This is a level 6 heading; it's the smallest</h6>
        </p>
        <p>HTML also makes it really easy to create pre-styled lists. The ones used the most are the unordered list (<strong>ul</strong>) and the ordered list (<strong>ol</strong>). You define your list by using one of the above tags, and then each individual item in your list must be then wrapped in the list (<strong>li</strong>) element.</p>
        <code>
          <strong>&lt;ul&gt;</strong>
            <strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong>Milk<strong>&lt;/li&gt;</strong>
            <strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong>Eggs<strong>&lt;/li&gt;</strong>
            <strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong>Diapers<strong>&lt;/li&gt;</strong>
          <strong>&lt;/ul&gt;</strong>
        </code>
        <p>
          The unordered list will look like this when rendered in the browser
          <ul>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Diapers</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>And an ordered list...</p>
        <code>
          <strong>&lt;ol&gt;</strong>
            <strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong>Sushi<strong>&lt;/li&gt;</strong>
            <strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong>Pizza<strong>&lt;/li&gt;</strong>
            <strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong>Bread<strong>&lt;/li&gt;</strong>
          <strong>&lt;/ol&gt;</strong>
        </code>
        <p>
          ...will look like this
          <ol>
            <li>Sushi</li>
            <li>Pizza</li>
            <li>Bread</li>
          </ol>
